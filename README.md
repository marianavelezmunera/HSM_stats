# HSM Stats
This is a mini project to rate and analyze all High School Musical soundtrack. 
After I shared the Taylor Swift's on my Twitter page I noted that many people were interested in the statistics behind and the explanation of the plots, so I decided to repeat the excersice with High School Musical and to use the data to do SciCom about statistical basics and methods.
For that I asked my best friend to evaluate the 3 movies of High School Musical, and with her scores and mine I did a little thread on Twitter talking about the basics of stats.
